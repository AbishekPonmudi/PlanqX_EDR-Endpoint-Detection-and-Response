## Overview
The **Custom Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solution** is designed to safeguard enterprise environments from a wide range of cyber threats by providing real-time detection, analysis, and response capabilities. This project integrates various advanced methodologies, including network traffic monitoring, malware detection, system behavior analysis, and research-driven enhancements, to create a robust cybersecurity solution.

## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this EDR solution are:

- **Real-Time Threat Detection:** Monitor endpoints for any signs of malicious activity, including malware execution, process injections, and other suspicious behaviors.
- **Advanced Analysis and Reporting:** Develop an integrated framework for comprehensive data collection, forward the collected data to a centralized server for analysis, and generate detailed reports on potential threats.
- **Modular and Scalable Design:** Create a modular architecture that allows easy integration of additional features and supports scaling to accommodate a large number of endpoints.
- **Leverage Malware Analysis Research:** Utilize the latest findings in malware analysis to improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives.

## System Architecture
The system architecture follows a client-server model to efficiently handle data collection, transmission, and analysis.

**Architecture Components:**
- **Client Module:** A lightweight client module is deployed on each endpoint. It continuously monitors system activity, collects relevant data, and transmits it to the centralized server for further analysis.
- **Forwarder Mechanism:** This mechanism ensures secure and efficient transmission of collected data from the client module to the server. It handles encryption, compression, and batching of data to optimize network usage.
- **Server Module:** A centralized server that receives data from multiple clients, processes it using various analysis techniques, and stores the results in a secure database.
- **Analysis Engine:** A key component that performs in-depth analysis of the collected data. It integrates multiple techniques, such as static and dynamic malware analysis, anomaly detection, and behavioral analysis, to identify potential threats.

## Project Workflow

### Data Collection
The data collection process is initiated by the client module, which gathers information from the endpoint. This data includes:

- **System Information:** Details about the operating system, hardware, installed applications, running processes, and system configurations.
- **Network Data:** Information on network connections, traffic patterns, and any unusual network activity.
- **File Activity Logs:** Data on file creation, modification, deletion, and any unauthorized access attempts.

### Data Forwarding
Once data is collected, the Forwarder Mechanism is responsible for transmitting it securely to the server. It ensures:

- **Data Encryption:** Uses strong encryption standards to protect data during transmission.
- **Compression:** Reduces data size to optimize network bandwidth usage.
- **Batching:** Groups smaller pieces of data into larger batches to minimize the frequency of transmission.

### Data Analysis
The serverâ€™s Analysis Engine processes the incoming data in several stages:

1. **Preprocessing:** Cleans and organizes the data to prepare it for analysis.
2. **Static Analysis:** Examines files and processes for known malware signatures, suspicious strings, or unusual attributes.
3. **Dynamic Analysis:** Observes the behavior of files and processes in a controlled environment to detect any malicious actions.
4. **Anomaly Detection:** Uses machine learning algorithms to identify deviations from normal behavior patterns.
5. **Rule-Based Detection:** Applies YARA rules and other detection techniques to identify specific types of threats.

### Alert Generation
If any malicious activity is detected, the system generates alerts with the following details:

- **Threat Type:** Categorizes the type of threat detected (e.g., malware, intrusion, suspicious behavior).
- **Severity Level:** Assesses the potential impact of the threat (e.g., low, medium, high).
- **Recommended Actions:** Provides guidance on how to respond to the detected threat (e.g., isolate endpoint, block network traffic).

### Reporting and Response
After generating alerts, the system creates detailed reports that can be accessed by the security team. These reports contain:

- **Incident Summary:** Overview of the detected threat, including the time of detection, affected endpoint, and threat type.
- **Detailed Analysis:** In-depth information on the threat, including the analysis results, observed behaviors, and any correlating factors.
- **Response Actions:** Suggested or automated actions taken by the system to mitigate the threat.

## Component Details

### Network Analysis Module
The Network Analysis Module is crucial for detecting network-based threats. It focuses on identifying patterns of malicious network behavior, such as:

- **Command and Control (C2) Communication:** Detects connections to known C2 servers used by attackers to control compromised endpoints.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Identifies unusual outbound traffic that could indicate an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive data.
- **Lateral Movement:** Monitors internal network traffic to detect unauthorized access attempts to other systems within the network.

**Techniques Used:**

- **Packet Capture and Analysis:** Captures network packets in real-time and analyzes them for any indicators of compromise.
- **Protocol Anomaly Detection:** Detects deviations from normal protocol usage, such as unusual DNS queries or unexpected HTTP requests.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Uses supervised and unsupervised machine learning models to detect anomalies in network traffic patterns.

### Malware Analysis and Detection
This module focuses on detecting malware through various analysis methods, including:

- **Static Analysis:** Examines executable files for known malware signatures, suspicious strings, imports/exports, and other static indicators.
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Executes files in a sandboxed environment to observe their behavior, detect malicious actions, and identify evasion techniques.
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Monitors the behavior of processes to detect any actions characteristic of malware, such as privilege escalation, code injection, or persistence mechanisms.

**Key Features:**

- **Integration with YARA Rules:** Uses YARA rules to identify malware families based on known patterns.
- **PE Analysis:** Examines Portable Executable (PE) files to detect anomalies in their headers, sections, and imports.
- **DLL Injection Detection:** Identifies unauthorized attempts to inject Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) into other processes.

### System-Level Analysis
The System-Level Analysis Module monitors the endpoint for suspicious activities at the system level, such as:

- **Process Monitoring:** Observes running processes, detects anomalies, and flags suspicious behaviors (e.g., unusual memory usage, code injection attempts).
- **Registry Monitoring:** Tracks changes to the system registry to detect malicious modifications (e.g., persistence mechanisms, malware configuration changes).
- **File System Monitoring:** Watches for unauthorized file access, creation, modification, or deletion activities.

**Techniques Used:**

- **Hooking and API Monitoring:** Monitors system calls and API usage to detect unauthorized activities.
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Identifies deviations from normal user and system behaviors.

### Forwarder Mechanism
The Forwarder Mechanism is a critical component that ensures reliable data transmission between the client and the server. It is responsible for:

- **Efficient Data Transfer:** Compresses and batches data to optimize network usage.
- **Secure Communication:** Encrypts data using strong encryption standards to prevent interception or tampering.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Handles network interruptions gracefully and retries data transmission if necessary.

## Data Collection and Analysis

### Data Collection
Data is collected from multiple sources, including:

- **System Logs:** Retrieves logs related to system events, such as process creation, file access, and network connections.
- **Network Traffic:** Captures network traffic data, including packet headers, payloads, and connection details.
- **Memory Dumps:** Analyzes memory dumps for any signs of malware or suspicious activities.
- **File Artifacts:** Collects file artifacts, such as executables, scripts, and documents, for further analysis.

### Data Analysis
The collected data is analyzed using a combination of:

- **Signature-Based Detection:** Compares collected data against known malware signatures and patterns.
- **Heuristic Analysis:** Uses heuristic techniques to detect new or unknown threats by identifying suspicious behaviors.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Applies machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies and predict potential threats.
